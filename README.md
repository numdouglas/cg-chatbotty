# Context-Generative Chatbot
Simple, accurate chatbot trained off a corpus of conversations to respond to real-time queries. 
<br />Uses Tensorflow Deep Neural Network to model the script and have responses that will be available and vary based on context.
<br />For classification, regression analysis is used, backed by the modern RELU which minimizes backpropagation of errors.
<br />NLP is used to create features which will be trained off Tensorflow's DNN's to attain a model with labels and context.
