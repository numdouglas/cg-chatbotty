# Context-Generative Chatbot
Simple, accurate and portable chatbot trained off a corpus of conversations to respond to real-time queries. 
* Uses Tensorflow Deep Neural Network to model the script and have responses that will be available and vary based on context.</li>
* For classification, regression analysis is used, backed by the modern RELU which minimizes backpropagation of errors.</li>
* NLP is used to create features which will be trained off Tensorflow's DNN's to attain a model with labels and context.</li>
* The chatbot is made to be embedabble to any webpage as a chat bubble, running multiple instances from a single server, via a Flask, REST and Vue.js Framework.</li>
